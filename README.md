Hello and welcome to our farming simulation game. In this second playtest you will try to make $1000 dollars by yourself or with another player locally by nurturing, selling, and catching the animals! In the game we have cow, sheep, pig, duck, and chicken for animals. And soy bean, worm, corn, carrot, and hay for the animals' food.

Animals can either be bought from the shop, and you have to buy food from the shop to feed them up in the farm, once they are fed up, you can use the food to feed them. Just a reminder, these animals are pretty picky with what they can eat, you can see what food each type of animal eats in the shop panel UI.

Animals can also be caught in the wild, if you have the food that they like, they will follow you once you are close to them. Only one animal will follow you at the time. 

Be careful of the wolf out in the wild, it will hunt the animal it sees, but it is scare of human, so you can walk over to scare it away from the animals.

You will be start the game in the main menu, you can either choose to play the game by yourself with an AI player or with another player locally, and the quit button will quit the game.
